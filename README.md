MSD Design System

This is the alpha stage for developing a design system to meet Government standards, WCAG 2.1 and Ministry of Social Development branding methodologies.

An inclusive design approach is being undertaken where accessibility is integrated at the earliest phase of the design process to limit updates within testing.

Currently there is Accessibility, Styles, Development Components and Design Patterns with there appropriate subsidiaries to come. The intention is to provide 
direction for both our staff internally and our vendors to work towards MSD protocols.

The framework is initially based off the All of Government (AoG) alpha release, references to gov.uk and communication with the Vendor working on the AoG release.
This will create a minimal transition when AoG reaches production.
