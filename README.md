Web Accessibility Standards

This is an accessibility reference system to meet Government standards and WCAG 2.1 methodologies.

An inclusive design approach has been undertaken where accessibility is integrated at the earliest phase of the design process to limit updates within testing.

Currently there is guidance for Product, Content Design, UX, Visual Design and Development with their appropriate subsidiaries. The intention is to provide 
direction for both staff internally and vendors to work towards company protocols.
