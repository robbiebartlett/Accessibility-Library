MSD Accessibility Standards

This is an accessibility reference system to meet Government standards, WCAG 2.1 and Ministry of Social Development methodologies.

An inclusive design approach has been undertaken where accessibility is integrated at the earliest phase of the design process to limit updates within testing.

Currently there is guidance for Product, Content Design, UX, Visual Design and Development with there appropriate subsidiaries. The intention is to provide 
direction for both our staff internally and our vendors to work towards MSD protocols.

The framework is initially based off the All of Government (AoG) alpha release, references to gov.uk and and digital.govt.nz.
This will create a minimal transition when AoG reaches production.
