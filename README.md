MSD Accessibility Standards

This is the preliminary stage for developing an accessibility design system to meet Government standards, WCAG 2.1 and Ministry of Social Development methodologies.

An inclusive design approach is being undertaken where accessibility is integrated at the earliest phase of the design process to limit updates within testing.

Currently there is guidance for Product, Content, UX, Visual Design and Development with there appropriate subsidiaries to come. The intention is to provide 
direction for both our staff internally and our vendors to work towards MSD protocols.

The framework is initially based off the All of Government (AoG) alpha release, references to gov.uk and communication with the Vendor working on the AoG release.
This will create a minimal transition when AoG reaches production.
